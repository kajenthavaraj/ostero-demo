## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration

Copy the environment template and configure your variables:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Set the following environment variables:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Database Setup

Ensure your Supabase database has the required tables:
- `applications` table with application data
- `call_logs` table with VAPI call data

Refer to the migration files in the parent project for the complete schema.

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Core Components

### Database Service (`src/lib/database.ts`)
- Centralized database operations
- Application CRUD operations
- Call log management
- Analytics data aggregation
- Real-time subscription setup

### Real-time Context (`src/contexts/realtime-context.tsx`)
- Supabase real-time subscriptions
- Live data synchronization
- Connection status management
- Cross-component state sharing

### Application Management

- Shared utilities in `lib/` directory
- Type definitions centralized in `types/`
- Real-time state management through contexts

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS for styling

- Custom CSS variables for theme colors
- Responsive design patterns

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript implementation
- Comprehensive type definitions for all data models
- Type-safe database operations
- Proper error handling throughout

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy automatically on push to main branch

### Manual Deployment
1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `.next` directory to your hosting provider
3. Ensure environment variables are configured

## Monitoring and Analytics
